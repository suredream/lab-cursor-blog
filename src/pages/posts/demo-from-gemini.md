Welcome to this experimental Astro-based blog, maintained with the help of the Gemini CLI. This setup demonstrates how AI can assist in content creation and repository management.

Here are some key aspects of this experimental setup:

*   **Astro for Static Site Generation**: The blog leverages Astro for its fast performance and modern developer experience, generating a static site that's easy to deploy.
*   **Gemini CLI for Maintenance**: The Gemini CLI acts as an autonomous agent, capable of understanding natural language requests and performing file-system operations like creating new posts or modifying existing layouts.
*   **Streamlined Content Workflow**: This integration aims to simplify the content creation and maintenance process, allowing for quick updates and additions to the blog through AI-driven commands.
